# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Description
This project demonstrates basic Python functionality, including:
1. Creating and manipulating lists.
2. Using the `random` module to select a random element.
3. Taking user input with the `input()` function.
4. Validating input to ensure it meets specified conditions.

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure the latest Python version is installed on your system. Download it from [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/) if necessary.
2. Clone the repository or download the `Milestone_2.py` file.
3. Open the file in a Python-compatible such as VSCode, Command (GitBash or powershell).
4. Make sure GitBash is installed. In VSCode, it can be confirmed that Gitbash installed by seeing (base) before the path.
5. If not, download it from [Gitbash Offical Website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
6. When installed restart your device. Then in search tab look for Gitbash to confirm it fully installed.

## Usage Instructions
1. All information given and can be extracted from the videos, notebooks given within the course and in additiion online through Stack Overflow and many websites to extract dictionaires, understand how VScode and Github works.

# Milestone_3

Check if the guessed character is in the word.

## Description

This project is a Hangman game where the player attempts to guess a word by guessing individual characters. The milestone focuses on implementing the core functionality of checking if a guessed character is part of the word using loops, iteration, and control flow. It also utilizes functions to organize the game's logic and make it more modular.

The aim of this milestone is to develop the logic that verifies whether a guessed character exists in the word, and to handle different game states like correct and incorrect guesses. This was achieved through the use of for loops for iteration over characters, control flow techniques to update the game state, and functions to structure the code in a clean and maintainable way.

In this milestone, I learned how to apply for loops to iterate over characters in a string, use control flow to handle different scenarios (such as correct or incorrect guesses), and create functions to encapsulate logic for easier readability and reusability. This helped me improve both my programming skills and my ability to organize code effectively.

# Milestone_4

Create the class game

## Description
This milestone implements the core logic for a Hangman game using the **`Hangman`** class, following **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The game randomly selects a word from a list, and the player guesses letters to reveal the word. Key features include:

- **Game initialization**: Random word selection and setting up lives and guessed letters.
- **Guess validation**: Ensures the playerâ€™s input is a valid, unique letter.
- **Word update**: Reveals correct guesses and decreases lives for incorrect ones.
- **Game over check**: Ends the game if the player wins or loses.

The project utilizes **functions (`def`)**, **control flow (`if` statements)**, and **loops** to structure the game and handle user input efficiently. The use of **OOP** allows the game logic to be encapsulated in the `Hangman` class, organizing the game state and behaviors in a modular, maintainable way. It teaches how to structure game logic into manageable pieces and track the game state effectively.

# Milestone_5

## Description
This milestone refines the Hangman game by modularizing functionality into smaller methods and introducing better input validation. The player guesses letters to reveal the word, and the game checks for win/loss conditions. Key improvements include managing the flow of the game, displaying the current word state, and reducing repeated code through function usage.
