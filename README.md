# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

## Description
This project demonstrates basic Python functionality, including:
1. Creating and manipulating lists.
2. Using the `random` module to select a random element.
3. Taking user input with the `input()` function.
4. Validating input to ensure it meets specified conditions.

## Installation Instructions
1. Ensure the latest Python version is installed on your system. Download it from [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/) if necessary.
2. Clone the repository or download the `Milestone_2.py` file.
3. Open the file in a Python-compatible such as VSCode, Command (GitBash or powershell).
4. Make sure GitBash is installed. In VSCode, it can be confirmed that Gitbash installed by seeing (base) before the path.
5. If not, download it from [Gitbash Offical Website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
6. When installed restart your device. Then in search tab look for Gitbash to confirm it fully installed.

## Usage Instructions
1. All information given and can be extracted from the videos, notebooks given within the course and in additiion online through Stack Overflow and many websites to extract dictionaires, understand how VScode and Github works.

## File Structure
- `Milestone_2.py`: The main script is in python form containing all functionality for this milestone.

## Description

This project is a Hangman game where the player attempts to guess a word by guessing individual characters. The milestone focuses on implementing the core functionality of checking if a guessed character is part of the word using loops, iteration, and control flow. It also utilizes functions to organize the game's logic and make it more modular.

The aim of this milestone is to develop the logic that verifies whether a guessed character exists in the word, and to handle different game states like correct and incorrect guesses. This was achieved through the use of for loops for iteration over characters, control flow techniques to update the game state, and functions to structure the code in a clean and maintainable way.

In this milestone, I learned how to apply for loops to iterate over characters in a string, use control flow to handle different scenarios (such as correct or incorrect guesses), and create functions to encapsulate logic for easier readability and reusability. This helped me improve both my programming skills and my ability to organize code effectively.
